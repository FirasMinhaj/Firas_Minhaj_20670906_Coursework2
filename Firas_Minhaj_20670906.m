%% TASK 4 - REFLECTIVE STATEMENT [5 MARKS]
% Overall, I found this coursework a challenge. I had to learn many new
% skills to be able to complete the questions but at the same time I got to
% learn a lot about coding in matlab. Some challenges I faced were: -
% Connecting the arduino circuit to get correct temperature readings. - It
% took me a while to understand how github works. - Errors would take a
% very long time to fix. However, my main strength while completing this
% coursework was my knowledge of coding and understanding computer
% language. I studied python for gcse and a levels and these skills deemed
% qquite useful when coding in matlab due to the shared similarities of the
% language with python. A limitation for completing this coursework was the vague nature of the brief document. Some tasks could have been explained in more detail to make it easier to understand.

%% TASK 5 - COMMENTING, VERSION CONTROL AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE [15 MARKS]

% No need to enter any answershere, but remember to:
% - Comment the code throughout.
% - Commit the changes to your git repository as you progress in your programming tasks.


% - Hand the Arduino project kit back to the lecturer with all parts and in working order.
